            <h1>Leadership</h1>
            <em><p>19th April 2017</p></em>
            <strong><p>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</p></strong>
            <p>
              This totally makes sense to me. When I think of those who have inspired me and made me want to work for them,
              I think of the people who practiced compassion. I can think of one manager in particular who I have an awful
              lot of respect for. After he left our organisation, I kept in touch and have done since. I visited him while
              in the UK recently and it felt like catching up with an old friend. I can think of other managers I have had
              over the years who I would cross the road to deliberately avoid. With the boss who I’ve kept in touch with
              though, he worked to build rapport and I always felt like he was there to help me. He was a good dude.
              Although he did support Spurs. Can’t have it all I guess.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</p></strong>
            <p>
              Difficult. I may not have the best visual imagination and I really struggled to imagine things. I felt calm a
              fterwards as I tend to after meditation. I will try this again.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</p></strong>
            <p>
              Difficult again for similar reasons. Again, I felt calm afterwards and will try this again. I have a few people
              in my life who aren’t having the best time right now and imagining trying to take their pain away wasn’t hard.
              However I’m still not exactly a zen master I guess.
            </p>
            <strong><p>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</p></strong>
            <p>
              nteresting to look at this. If I’m honest, doing EDA is kinda scary. I’m walking away from a pretty well paid job (certainty)
              which I am good at (status) with people I get on with (relatedness). However, I don’t always feel like I can achieve what I
              want to (autonomy). So I guess those points can apply to my life in general over the course of Phase 0 and more so with the
              upcoming Bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a more positive light, I have been exploring the possibility of moving into a web development role for some time and this
              feels like me finally grabbing an opportunity and impacting my own environment rather than being hung up on comfort and certainty.
            </p>
            <p>
              I guess I am hoping that the cohort will help to stand up and help provide some of these basic needs for everyone else. Everyone
              I’ve met (both online and in person) so far seem awesome and I get the impression that EDA is going to foster a spirit of fairness
              as well as autonomy. It doesn’t seem like the kind of educational experience where we are required to rote learn and aren’t able
              to drive things ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, hopefully everyone comes out of it with some certainty in where they want to go and is able to level up continually against
              their former selves.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</p></strong>
            <p>
              I have been in a managerial role over the past year and I’ve had plenty of these conversations. I do struggle with them. I had one
              earlier today and I approached it knowing that it was to help give some longer term advice to a colleague. He may not have
              appreciated being told he could improve in an area but I believe that having the conversation will help him get along better with
              people in the long term. However, these things are really hard. I try to approach them with the best intentions and only when I need
              to. If I can chicken out, then I probably will. This is somewhere I need to get better.
            </p>
