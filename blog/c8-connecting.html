            <em><p>16th April 2017</p></em>
            <strong><p>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</p></strong>
            <p>
              A lot of this section of the chapter resonated with me and this is generally how I try
              to go about my life. I am a strong believer in trust being a cornerstone of any relationship,
              personal of professional. Trust leads to honesty and without it, we really are left
              in a state where things just aren't clear, open or honest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consequently, a lack of trust can create poisonous places to work and a second guessing
              of everyone's motivations. This can really suck!
            </p>
            <p>
              I haven't tried any of the specific techniques. But I will do so over the next while to see how I
              get on.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</p></strong>
            <p>
              I have been having to do this a lot recently at work as tensions rise at the pointy
              end of a large piece of work. I try to realise that everyone has motivation's
              behind why they want to do something and that they are, after all, human, probably.
            </p>
            <strong><p>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</p></strong>
            <p>
              Good. I will be using this technique to try to deal with some people in the office whom
              I don't have the best relationship with.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</p></strong>
            <p>
              Me: On a piece of work I was involved with over the past few months, I was asked to write and
              present a paper to a technical advisory board. I drafted the paper presenting a number of options
              based on a number of years experience doing what I do. It was a pretty good paper. It listed
              a number of options and suggested the best course of action for a particular piece of work.
            </p>
            <p>
              My colleague: Reviewed the paper and asked that several of the options were removed from the
              paper. This was because he felt that it would muddy the presentation to the technical board.
              He felt that it would not make our team look good as we had already gone down one path, which
              probably wasn't the best option.
            </p>
            <p>
              Me: I felt like I was being over-ridden by a colleague who had less technical experience than me
              who was trying to cover himself as he had pushed us down one path.
            </p>
            <p>
              My colleague: Really just wanted to achieve an outcome that would meet milestones and would deliver
              enough of the user requirements so as to be useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ended up having a pretty frank discussion about this. We both agreed that the options would be removed.
              The paper went through fine and the work is going to deliver what our end users require. So happy days.
              I found the exchange a little frustrating. But I was able to see that my colleague did have motives that
              were around getting things done. Building more trust with that colleague would have helped as I was constantly
              second guessing his motives.
