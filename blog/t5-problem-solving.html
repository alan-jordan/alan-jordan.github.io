            <h1>Problem solving</h1>
            <em><p>22nd March 2017<p></em>
            <strong><p>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got
              blocked on a simple problem</p></strong>
            <p>
              I had to write a small program which changed the colour of elements
              of a web site.
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, I tried working through the code that I knew worked.
              This allowed me to identify that the problem wasn’t with something
              simple like a typo. I then did some googling to work out why I wasn’t
              able to assign the colour properly based on the code that I had written.
              I also looked at error messages in the web browser console to identify
              what could be causing the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              I felt a little frustrated as I believed that I knew how to do what I wanted.
              However, doing the research allowed me to identify what was causing the problem
              and to try and fix it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learnt that I may be a little over confident with my Javascript
              abilities and that I needed to do a little more study, particularly
              on how ‘event handlers’ work. Event handlers do things on a web page
              based on a user action. Something like clicking on something for
              example. I did some more reading using the Mozilla Dev Network
              documentation and this was very useful.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you solved
              a problem in an elegant way</p></strong>
            <p>
              I worked through a problem this week which involved writing a small
              program to print a chessboard pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used pseudocode to solve the problem. This involves working out
              what you want the program to do, writing it out in something resembling
              English and then working out what steps will be required to be programmed
              to solve the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              I felt confident at first as I thought I had worked out how to solve
              the problem quite quickly. However, it soon transpired that I had made
              an error with my pseudocode which left me frustrated. Once I had figured
              out what the problem was by breaking down the problem line by line,
              I started to feel good that my original thoughts had turned out to be
              pretty much correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learnt that I need to take my time when writing pseudocode and
              not to just throw myself into it. I need to consider as many
              eventualities as I can as not doing so led my program to just spit
              out the wrong information.
            </p>
            <em><p>Update</p></em>
            <p>
              After reading Thomasina's code to solve the same problem, mine looks
              anything but elegant. I've folowed through her code and it looks
              an awful lot better than my sprawling loops within loops. I will look
              to make my next lot of code a little more elegant.
            </p>
            <strong><p>
              How confident do you feel on the following problem solving
              techniques?
            </p></strong>
            <p><strong>Pseudocode: </strong></p>
            <p>
              Fairly confident although I still need to practice this some more.
              I found it very useful this week when working out some slightly
              more complex and gnarly problems.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Trying something: </strong></p>
            <p>
              I tend to this a lot. I work with Puppet a lot in my current job
              and if I’m not sure how to solve a problem, I will create something
              in Puppet and just start to allow my code to grow from there.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong></p>
            <p>
              I haven’t tried this method yet. It sounds interesting and I have
              had it recommended to me previously. I will try it next time I am
              stuck on a problem.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Reading error messages: </strong></p>
            <p>
              `tail -f /var/log/messsages` is pretty much my life at the moment.
              I am constantly looking for error messages when things go wrong on
              servers so I am okay with this one.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Console.logging: </strong></p>
            <p>
              Okay with this one. I tend to insert console.log(“win”); into loops
              if I’m not sure if the conditions are right. If I don’t get any
              console output, then there is something wrong with my loop condition
              and I can work forward from that. I’m still working out how to use
              the Chrome Dev Tools a little more effectively though.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Googling: </strong></p>
            <p>
              Stackoverflow? Couldn’t do my job without it. Tend to try and narrow
              searches down using error messages or any kind of helpful looking
              output I can find.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong></p>
            <p>
              Happy to do this. Haven’t been blocked too many times in the first
              5 weeks so haven’t had to on Slack too much yet. However, I’m willing
              to put my hands up when I don’t know something and ask for a bit of help.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong></p>
            <p>
              Again, haven’t been too stuck yet so haven’t had to ask for too
              much help. But I will definitely do so when I need to. I know that
              I don’t know everything and I will not suffer in silence.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong></p>
            <p>
              Not that confident on this one. I have been working on it over the
              course of my time in Phase 0 and I have found it to be immensely helpful.
              I have a tendency to solve a problem quickly and for that moment in time,
              and not to actually take in how I’ve fixed it. This is very frustrating,
              especially if something happens again and I haven’t documented how I
              fixed it somewhere. So this is definitely something that I would like to
              improve upon.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what
              these functions do in your own words:</p></strong>
            <p><em>.map() -</em> Map will call another function on the items in an array
              and return the result. The original array will remain the same but
              the returned array will show the impact of the mapped function.
              For example, you could apply a function to an array which added 1
              to each element of the array. You could then have something like
              array = [1,2,3] and mappedArray = [2,3,4].
            </p>
            <p><em>.filter() -</em> Filter will filter the contents of an array
              based on a function. For example, you could filter based on whether
              or not the contents of an array are a positive number or not.
            </p>
            <p><em>.reduce() -</em>Reduce will allow the contents of an array
              to be reduced or flattened. It can be used to create a sum of all parts
              of an array. Or reduce a collection of strings into a single single
              string. Not 100% sure how this works yet though.
