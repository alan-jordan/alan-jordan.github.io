        <li>Bold Header which clearly looks like a header.</li>
        <li>A slide away effect on the menu bar as you slide beyond the header</li>
        <li>A simple bold colour scheme with more accents than I currently have.</li>

        <li>A bold, chunky footer.</li>

      <h2>What are HTML, CSS and the DOM</h2>
      <p>HTML defines the structure of a web page.</p>
      <p>CSS defines how a web page looks.</p>
      <p>The DOM describers the underlying structure of a web site in a tree
      like structure.</p>

      <p>What is meant by boxifying design?</p>
      <p>Boxifying design means breaking up a design into all of it's box like elements.
      This could be done using a graphics application and would allow the tranlsation of
      a design into something that can be carved up to be then rendered using HTML & CSS.
      This works because all elements in HTML are in fact boxes.</p>

      <p>What is the box model?</p>
      <p>The box model defines how an element on a site is displayed. The box comprises of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content: This is the actual content of the element. It could be an image, some text
        or other elements defined by the HTML.</li>
        <li>Padding: This provides space around the Content before getting to any border.</li>
        <li>Border: This allows developers to render a border around the element and the
        padding.</li>
        <li>Margin: This provides space outside the border which other elements are not able
        to cross into.</li>
      </ul>
