            <h1>Meditation</h1>
            <em><p>11th March 2017</p></em>
            <strong><p>
              How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way
              you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
            </p></strong>
            <p>
              It helped me to eventually stop fiddling with my CSS. I really
              went down the rabbit hole playing with Skeleton and I couldn't quite
              get my site to be responsive. Eventually, I went back to this mantra
              and decided that I needed to stop. Funnily enough, when I went back
              the next day, what I was trying to do came a lot easier. I learnt
              that I do need to stop and take a step back at times and not just
              continue coding furiously.
            </p>
            <strong><p>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</p></strong>
            <p>
              To be honest, it isn’t something I’ve ever really considered doing.
              I come from a family with a fairly cynical and dark sense of humour
              (the joys of being from Northern Ireland) and meditation, or talking
              about doing it would just lead to me being the target of some joke or
              other. However, the basic way of meditating is something like how I
              try to relax and calm myself down anyway. If I cannot sleep at night,
              I tend to sit calmly, relax my muscles and focus heavily on my breathing.
              So it looks like I’ve been meditating for years and I didn’t even know it.
            </p>
            <strong><p>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</p></strong>
            <p>
              I liked the information about getting past distractions. Again, when
              I’ve tried drifting off to sleep by using breathing techniques, I do
              tend to let my mind wander and this prevents me from relaxing. I sat
              for a while this afternoon trying to meditate like this and I was able
              to push most things away and just try to relax. It seemed to work and
              it is definitely something I am going to try doing.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</p></strong>
            <p>Again, the section on dealing with distractions was interesting.</p>
            <strong><p>Any other musings?</p></strong>
            <p>
              I found it interesting that meditation is basically just deep breathing
              and trying to reach a relaxed but alert state. I had visions of having
              to sit in the lotus position while trying yogic flying. However, the
              reality seems quite different.
