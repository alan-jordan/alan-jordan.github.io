    <ul class="question_and_answers">
      <li class="question">What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
      <li class="answer">Excited. It sounds like a collaborative experience
        which will allow a group to grow together and build something together.
        I studied at Uni and quite often the whole thing felt like a box-ticking
        exercise where I was paying my fees, consuming a good and coming out at
        the end with a degree which would hopefully get me a job. This sounds
        totally different and I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty and throw
        myself into the experience and hopefully help myself, and the rest of my
        cohort grow, make some new friends and learn some new skills.</li>
      <li class="answer">I am also excited that the Bootcamp is there to help students learn
        trough practical learning. I have wanted to move into web development for some time.
        Being able to do so, without going back to Uni sounds great. I’ve been advised by a web
        developer friend that half of his Computer Science degree was entirely
        superfluous to what he does day to day. </li>
      <li class="question">What are your impressions?</li>
      <li class="answer">I love the emphasis on giving and not just taking.
        I’ve worked in a number of work places since I finished Uni and the best
        ones have always been where people have been willing to help everyone
        else in the team learn. </li>
      <li class="question">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
      <li class="answer">I am keen to immerse myself in it. I am naturally quite
        introverted and a little shy, so I am going to have to work through that
        and manage it to make sure that I don’t burn out but that I also get enough
        from the experience. I really like the comment about the headphones policy
        as listening to music helps me immensely when I am stressed. </li>
      <li class="answer">I am also excited about starting somewhere that is open
        to new ideas and thinking. I have felt myself becoming jaded and cynical
        at work over recent years. I want to engage in this process to try to
        overcome this and start to love what I do again.</li>
      <li class="question">Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
      <li class="answer">The time commitment comments were interesting. I knew
        it would be intense, and I had thought about it previously. However, I
        guess that know that phase 0 has begun, it has now become a bit more real. </li>
      <li class="answer">However, no, I don’t think my expectations have changed.
        I did a lot of reading and research before committing to EDA so I’m going
        in eyes open. </li>
      <li class="question">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?
        Does it make you nervous?</li>
      <li class="answer">Yes, I am definitely excited. I did a course years ago
        about ‘team alchemy’ and how different members of a team add together to
        achieve something greater than the sum of their parts. I hope EDA will be
        something like this. Hopefully the cohort can, together, help to turn of
        each of us into budding web developers.</li>
      <li class="answer">I’m not really nervous. Going back to being an introvert,
        pair programming all day long will be something I will have to work on.
        I struggle at the moment at work when I have a full day of meetings,
        I get home exhausted having talked to people all day long. I hope though,
        that the excitement of what we will be building together will get me through
        it. It is something that I will need to be mindful of.</li>
