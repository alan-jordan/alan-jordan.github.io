      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <h2>Things I took from the first chapter of Search Inside Yourself</h2>
        <p>
          The mind isn’t a fixed ‘thing’. It is something that can be shaped to
          extract more use from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The discussion of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was very interesting.
          I have experience with a loved one who has benefitted immensely from CBT.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also found the notes on physical sensations and emotions interesting.
          I definitely feel things physically. When very angry, I shake and tense
          up muscles. When relieved, I can almost feel tension draining away.
        </p>
        <p>
            My wife and I used to joke about the feeling of tension lifting as we
            crossed the M25 on a train when leaving London. Living in London can
            leave you coiled up like a spring. When going away for a weekend, that
            spring used to gradually relax as I got further away from the city.
            Disclaimer, I still love London but I don’t miss being a bit wound up
            all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two minute of mindfulness idea is interesting. I already do practice
          something like this at times. I have been trying to stop using my mobile
          phone so much when on public transport or waiting to meet someone. Instead,
          I try to just sit there and enjoy the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will definitely try the two minutes of mindfulness technique before
          sleeping to try and train myself to be more mindful.
