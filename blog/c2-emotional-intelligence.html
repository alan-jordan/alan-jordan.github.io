            <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
            <em><p>2nd March 2017</p></em>
            <strong><p>Things I took from the first chapter of Search Inside Yourself</p></strong>
            <p>
              The mind isn’t a fixed ‘thing’. It is something that can be shaped to
              extract more use from it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The discussion of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was very interesting.
              I have experience with a loved one who has benefitted immensely from CBT.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also found the notes on physical sensations and emotions interesting.
              I definitely feel things physically. When very angry, I shake and tense
              up muscles. When relieved, I can almost feel tension draining away.
            </p>
            <p>
                My wife and I used to joke about the feeling of tension lifting
                as we crossed the M25 on a train when leaving London. Living in
                London can leave you coiled up like a spring. When going away for
                a weekend, that spring used to gradually relax as I got further away
                from the city. Disclaimer, I still love London but I don’t miss being
                a bit wound up all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two minute of mindfulness idea is interesting. I already do
              practice something like this at times. I have been trying to stop
              using my mobile phone so much when on public transport or waiting
              to meet someone. Instead, I try to just sit there and enjoy the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will definitely try the two minutes of mindfulness technique before
              sleeping to try and train myself to be more mindful.
            </p>
