      <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
      <p>Grid based design means breaking up sections of a web page into grids and
      positioning content appropriately. This particuarly suits the web as all elements
      on a page are boxes and the box model defines how elements are positioned and
      represented.</p>

      <h2>Whatis all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
      <p>How we view the web is changing. Desktops and laptops are getting higher
      resolution displays, mobile phones are now one of the most commone ways of
      viewing web sites and tablets are also commonplace.</p>
      <p>Because of this, designing a page for a 1024 x 768 monitor are over.
      Pages are loaded on numerous types of browsers with vastly varying screen sizes.
      Not taking this into account would mean that pages just won't look right on some
      devices. Practicing responsive design means that sites can dynamically adjust how
      they look based on screen size or device type.</p>


      <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
      <p>Semantic structure allows humans to read HTML code as well as browsers. For
      example, H1 is a semantic tag representing header 1. This is interpreted by the
      browser as it will know what it means. It is also easy for a human to understand.
      The same goes with the tag used to define images, IMG.</p>

      <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
      <p>I really like the Code->Test->Refine idea in the Udacity video. It is how
      I have been working through any CSS and HTML work I have been doing this week.
      I find that it makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
