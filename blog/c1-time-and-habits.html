    <h1>Time and habits</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="question">Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
      <li class="answer">I tried the Pomodoro technique and the time box technique
      to work through some readings.</li>
      <li class="question">What did you find interesting?</li>
      <li class="answer">I found the readings and videos on habit making very interesting.
      I particuarly like the idea of the Fogg method to build habits which will help to make
      long term changes to behaviour.</li>
      <li class="question">What worked for you?</li>
      <li class="answer">The Pomodoro technique worked and I found the enforced break of
      five minutes to allow me to actually stop to turn things over rather than charging
      on regardless.</li>
      <li class="question">Which will you experiment further with?</li>
      <li class="answer">I will experimen with the mindfulness techniques and I will download
      the headspace app to my phone to see how I find that. I will also look to build some
      small habits to help change my behaviour to see how that goes.</li>
