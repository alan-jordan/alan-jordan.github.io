            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <em><p>8th April 2017</p></em>
            <strong><p>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</p></strong>
            <p>
              The pleasure, passion and purpose lens is an interesting way to analyse our lives. It makes a lot
              of sense to me and it is part of the reason I am actually attending EDA. I don’t feel that my work
              recently has aligned with my core values and I just haven’t felt passionate about it or that it I was
              contributing to a higher purpose. The pay was nice which definitely gave me a pleasure jolt, but I
              just wasn’t fulfilled. I hope to leave EDA and move somewhere that I do feel passionate about and
              that I can hopefully feel like I am actually contributing to a higher purpose. The last time I felt
              this way, I was working a small charity. Knowing that I was helping people gave me a real buzz and
              I want to get that back!
            </p>
            <strong><p>My Core Values and what I stand for.</p></strong>
            <p>
              <strong>Honesty: </strong>I value honesty in people. Honesty through things like telling the truth
              and not being deceptive. But I also value people who are able to be honest when things aren’t going
              well and are brave enough to stand up and say so. There isn’t enough of that in the world. We often
              just stick our fingers in our ears and pretend things aren’t happening.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Fairness and helping things to be more equitable: </strong>The world isn’t fair sadly. Things
              are becoming more and more unequal and this is going to bite us all down the line. I believe in working
              to make things more equitable so that everyone has the same opportunity, no matter where they have come
              from. I don’t particularly like privilege and knowing that if you are born with the proverbial silver
              spoon, you are almost guaranteed to succeed. That just isn’t fair. We should all be able to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Being nice: </strong>People aren’t nice enough. It isn’t hard really. I remember a colleague I
              of mine years ago  had a poster on her wall which just said, “Work hard and be nice to people.” It is a
              little sad that more people don’t do those two things as it would make everyone’s lives a lot better.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Working Hard (and together): </strong>I work hard and I appreciate it when people I’m working with do as
                well. I like feeling like I am striving to achieve something that is bigger than myself and when I do,
                I will graft and make sure that I help the people around me to achieve that thing too.
            </p>
            <strong><p>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise</p></strong>
            <p>
              Good. I know how I feel when I feel like I’ve messed up and I feel like I can use these techniques to hopefully
              build more resilience. I am naturally a pretty optimistic person though, as an Aston Villa fan, one hast to be.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Other musings</p></strong>
            <p>
              I liked the exercise imagining where I will be in five years if things go well. I definitely feel that EDA is
              going to be a big part of this.
