            <h1>Self Confidence</h1>
            <em><p>22nd March 2017</p></em>
            <strong><p>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</p></strong>
            <p>
              Mindfulness and self awareness are very similar going by the definitions
              from this chapter. The two quotes outlining what they are sum it up quite well.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <em>"Self-awareness â€¦ is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in
              the midst of turbulent emotions."</em> - Daniel Goleman.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <em>"Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose,
              in the present moment, and non-judgmentally."</em> - Jon Kabat-Zinn.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Both are very similar going by these quotes and the chapter suggests
              that by practicing mindfulness, it will allow one to train self-awareness.
              Both espouse a view of mastering the ability to not be dictated to by
              emotions and to react objectively, and logically (Spock?) to a situation.
            </p>
            <strong><p>
              Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter
              (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
            </p></strong>
            <p>
              I tried body scanning. Not quite sure I got the hang of it. Amusingly, as per
              the note in the book, I really, really felt like going to sleep while trying
              it. I couldn't quite focus on my neck and shoulders while trying to do this
              so don't thnk I really figured it out. I will try it again though and see
              how I find it.
            </p>
            <strong><p>
              What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
            </p></strong>
            <p>
              I very much like the idea. I probably let my heart rule my head a
              little too much and I do often find myself taken by emotion when
              stepping back and looking at something objectively would really
              really help. I am looking forward to the next chapter and its
              discussion on dealing with negative emotions.
            </p>
