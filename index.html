      Welcome to my site. This is for me to test new skills and techinques as
      part of my time studying at Enspiral Dev Academy. I'm Alan, I have been
      messing around with computers since my family bought an AmstradCPC-464.
      I learnt the most basic of BASIC programming and made my computer
      swear, in an infinite loop. I thought it was glorious. It wasn't really.
